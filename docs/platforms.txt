The platforms that we want to focus on:

  - Amazon Fire TV + Fire tablets
    - Amazon Fire tablets use FireOS which is essentially Android under the hood,
      but they don't pack Google Play Store or Google Play Services.
      They have their own Amazon App Store which supports adding hosted apps, which are URLs wrapped to an app.
      We can test websites with the help of:
      https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Digital-Services-Inc-Tester/dp/B00DZ3I1W8 on Android devices
      Just FYI: these devices have their own web-browser: Amazon Silk.

  - Windows 10 ecosystem (Win Phone, Win Tablet, Xbox One, etc.)
    - Microsoft Windows OS supports UWP (Universal Windows Platform) which
      packages your existing website for publishing to the Store.

      This includes all Windows-based devices, including PCs, tablets, phones, HoloLens, Surface Hub, Xbox and Raspberry Pi.

  - Opera TV
    - Opera TV can be tested using their emulator: http://www.operasoftware.com/products/tv/tv-developer-tools
      Technical documentation about app requirements for Opera TV: http://acp.otvs.tv/doc/
      They support standard HTML5, CSS3, JS.

  - LG WebOS
    - LG WebOS is not very popular, so the knowledge surrounding it is fairly limited.
      It supports wrapped web apps. The devs can emulate it in VirtualBox.

  - Samsung Tizen OS
    - Samsung Tizen OS - they have a clean guide how to run their emulator,
      they provide a number of dev tools to help with app building for their OS.

      For some reason I couldn't manage yet to run the emulator in UNIX env.
